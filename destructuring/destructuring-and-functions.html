  Things to remember from this lesson:
  1) You can return several items in a function by destructuring them in an object
  2) you can pick and choose what items to display from an object
  3) Function Arguments dont have to be tied to the order the arguments are listed.

  // This function will take a value, and return several converted rates
  function convertCurrency(amount) {
    const converted = {
      USD: amount * 0.76,
      GPB: amount * 0.53,
      AUD: amount * 1.01,
      MEX: amount * 13.30
    };
    return converted;
  }
/*
Though you cannot return multiple items in a return statement, you
can return an object with multiple values.
Below an array of objects is created and they set it to the value of
the function, convertCurrency, run on 100.
 */

 const { AUD, MEX } = convertCurrency(100);
 console.log(AUD, MEX);


/*
How about default named functions?
How to make these function arguments NOT depend on the order they are
entered into the function?
The ARGUMENTS can be DESTRUCTURED with the curly braces.
 */
  function tipCalc({ total = 100, tip = 0.15, tax = 0.13 } = {}) {
    return total + (tip * total) + (tax * total);
  }

// tipCalc needs three variables. If there are defaults set, you can get by with only passing in two object
  const bill = tipCalc({ tip: 0.20, total: 200 });
  console.log(bill);
