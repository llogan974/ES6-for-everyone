Shift Option A adds a block-level comment.

Benefits of arrow functions: 
1) implicit returns. 
2) Shorter and more concise. 
3) Doesnt rebind "This" when using arrow function inside another function (like click handlers)


Questions I can answer now:
What are IMPLICIT RETURNS?
How to pass in ARGUMENTS to an arrow function?
How to pass in ARGS when defined as a CONST?

  If only 1 parameter, you can do this  (remove parens around "name"):

  names = name of array from above
  map = method being used
  name = variable being passed in. It is being created here and is not defined elsewhere.

  Named functions, like first item below, are good for tracing when there is a bug.
