  /*
  ...Rest takes many items, and packs them into a single array.
  It is the exact opposite of SPREAD.

  Take below, if you dont know how many 'amounts' there are:
  */
  function convertCurrency(rate, ...amounts) {
    // This will take the first arg (rate), and display it.
    // All other args will be passed into an array called "amounts"
    console.log(rate, amounts);
    return amounts.map(amount => amount * rate);
  }

  const amounts = convertCurrency(1.54, 10, 23, 52, 1, 56);
  console.log(amounts);


  // Another example:
  const runner = ['Wes Bos', 123, 5.5, 5, 3, 6, 35];

  // First item is name, second is id, and all others are "runs"
  // All "runs" are bundled into an array
  const [name, id, ...runs] = runner;
  console.log(name, id, runs);

  // We looked at this in a previous lesson:
  const team = ['Wes', 'Kait', 'Lux', 'Sheena', 'Kelly'];
  const [captain, assistant, ...players] = team;
  console.log(captain, assistant, players)
