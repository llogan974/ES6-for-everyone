  /*
  A great use of spread operators is spreading into a function
  In this example, take both arrays an put into 1 array
  Old way was this, but hard to understand

  This old method below, takes inventors, will push items to it, using
  the "apply" method, and it runs the function you run apply against,
  for every item in the argument:

  inventors.push.apply(inventors, newInventors);
   */
  const inventors = ['Einstein', 'Newton', 'Galileo'];
  const newInventors = ['Musk', 'Jobs'];

  // Using spread operator:
  inventors.push(...newInventors);
  console.log(inventors);

  const name = ['Wes', 'Bos'];

  function sayHi(first, last) {
    alert(`Hey there ${first} ${last}`);
  }
/*
Old way:
sayHi(name[0], name[1]);

If there are a lot of arguments, this wont work. Instead, spread all items
from the array 'name' into the function
*/
  sayHi(...name);
